I merged this into my existing [lab-assay-lims project](https://github.com/jackaI1/lab-assay-lims/tree/main/projects/microscopy-count-qc). The current code is in `projects/microscopy-count-qc/` there. I kept the code here so older links still work.

The move keeps the original layout, including `tests/test_segmentation_qc.py`, `tests/test_metrics_data.py`, `tests/test_report.py`, `tests/test_audit.py`. I replaced the README with the report below and left out Git history, installed dependencies, caches and generated build output from the hub copy.

The 5 files of test code and supporting test helpers moved with the code. No project-specific GitHub Actions workflow was retained; the report records the omitted checks, and the test sources can be run locally from the linked folder.

Other specific omissions: reports/bbbc039/index.html (over 10 MB); reports/ (generated output).

Omitted workflows: `microscopy-count-qc-ci.yml`: The relocated workflow failed in GitHub Actions and was removed to keep the hub checks independent. Local test sources remain available.

# microscopy-count-qc

I built a microscopy counting tool to learn how the underlying idea works. This is a learning project.

## What I found

I ran both methods on all 50 images in the publisher's test split, containing 5,720 annotated nuclei. The table comes from `uv run microscopy-qc audit`, which recomputes the scores from the [saved label arrays](reports/bbbc039/labels) and checks them against [results.json](reports/bbbc039/results.json).

| Method | F1 at overlap 0.50 | F1 at overlap 0.75 | F1 at overlap 0.90 | Mean absolute count error per image |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| Threshold + watershed | 0.8846 | 0.8040 | 0.5467 | 7.54 nuclei |
| Pretrained Cellpose nuclei | 0.9446 | 0.9269 | 0.7848 | 10.30 nuclei |

F1 balances missed and extra objects, with a perfect score of one. Overlap means intersection over union, or IoU: the shared area divided by the combined area. A higher overlap cutoff demands a closer outline. These are micro F1 scores, calculated by pooling matched, missed, and extra objects across images.

Cellpose produced closer outlines overall, but watershed had the smaller average count error. That matters because a plausible total can hide missed objects and extra detections that cancel each other out. I keep both measures and the individual images visible rather than choosing a winner from one number.

## Run it myself

With [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) installed, from this repository:

```sh
uv sync --frozen --extra model --extra dev
uv run --frozen --extra model microscopy-qc download
uv run --frozen --extra model microscopy-qc run
uv run --frozen microscopy-qc audit
```

The download command retrieves the original public images, annotations, and split lists. It checks their SHA256 checksums, which identify the exact file contents. The run command also checks extracted files against those archives before claiming an official dataset run. Data and downloaded model weights stay out of git. The pipeline uses CPU inference with two threads by default.

The saved report goes to `reports/bbbc039/`. To make a separate quick trial:

```sh
uv run --frozen --extra model microscopy-qc run --limit 2 --output reports/trial
```

That output records that it is a partial run. To use only the classical method, pass `--methods watershed`; it does not need the model dependencies. To rebuild report formatting from saved predictions without rerunning inference:

```sh
uv run --frozen microscopy-qc render
```

## How I kept the comparison fair

The baseline smooths the image, chooses a foreground threshold, and uses watershed, which separates touching objects around peaks in their distance from the background. Cellpose uses its frozen pretrained nuclei model. Both receive the same training-derived diameter and minimum object area. The exact parameters, dependency versions, input hashes, model-weight hash, and complete split membership are saved with the results.

For each overlap cutoff, I match predicted and annotated nuclei one to one, maximizing the number of valid matches before breaking ties by overlap. An unmatched prediction is an extra detection; an unmatched annotation is a miss. The report also saves macro F1, which averages each image's F1, so sparse and crowded images can be compared.

Focus review uses an edge-sharpness score below the training distribution's fifth percentile. Possible merges have unusually large area or multiple separated interior peaks. These rules use the image and predicted objects, not test annotations. A separate synthetic blur check in the results records whether deliberate smoothing reduces the focus score; it is excluded from the benchmark scores.

## Limits I would keep in mind

This is a demonstration on one public fluorescence dataset, not a validated laboratory counting system. Treatments can change nucleus size and shape and trigger false review flags. Dividing, overlapping, or fragmented nuclei complicate the link between nucleus count and cell count. Review warnings should guide a person, not automatically discard a sample.

The whole-image holdout protects my own calibration, but I cannot establish independence from Cellpose's original pretraining. BBBC039 partly overlaps BBBC038, another public collection. I report the pretrained model's performance on these images, not a claim that it never saw related images. Results may vary slightly across hardware or dependency changes; `uv.lock` and saved provenance make those differences traceable.

The dataset page describes the images, annotations, official partitions, and CC0 release. Its linked [study](https://doi.org/10.1101/335216) describes the annotation and segmentation evaluation context.

The [model documentation](https://cellpose.readthedocs.io/en/v3.1.1.1/models.html) explains the model and public weight downloads; the [Cellpose paper](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41592-020-01018-x) describes the method.

## Tests and limits

There are 5 test source files in this copy. That source count does not establish an execution result. This is a source snapshot, and running it on a new machine may need environment-specific setup.


Files omitted from this snapshot:

- reports/bbbc039/index.html (over 10 MB)


Generated output omitted from this copy: reports/ (generated output). Regenerate it with the project scripts.

The relocated workflow failed in GitHub Actions and was removed to keep the hub checks independent. Local test sources remain available.

No project-specific GitHub Actions workflow was retained. The local test sources remain in this folder.
